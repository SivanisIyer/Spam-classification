# Spam-classification

Introduction
Spam detection is a crucial task in modern communication systems, aimed at filtering out unwanted or malicious messages from genuine ones. It is widely applied in email filtering, SMS screening, social media moderation, and online forums. With the rise of digital communication, automated spam detection has become essential to prevent phishing attacks, malware distribution, and unwanted advertisements.

Machine Learning Approaches
Involves training classifiers on labeled datasets to differentiate between spam and non-spam messages.

Common algorithms include:
Na√Øve Bayes Classifier: Uses probabilistic techniques based on word frequency.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Creates a decision boundary for classification.
Random Forest: Uses multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
Requires feature engineering, such as extracting word frequency, sender details, and message structure.
